                Trees With Faces, TWF!, is a community-driven NFT collection of
                3,333 programmatically generated freaking cool trees seeded and
                living as NFTs on the Ethereum Blockchain. Some are cool. Others
                look weird. And some are simply unique, rare and even animated!
              </p>
              <p>
                Each Tree With Faces is a collectible that has been curated and
                randomly assembled from over 500k total options, each of them
                featuring shapes, outfits, faces and other peculiar elements
                that make each of them cool and rare on their own. Each TWF! is
                unique and no two are alike.
              </p>
              <p>
                Entering the TWF! world, you don't only hold an awesome PFP, but
                also join a family of cool friends in the Metaverse, with
                incentives like experiences, campaigns, $TREES token, liquidity
                pool, passive rewards, charity donation and much more. Are you

            that's not all, folks. TWF! is a community-driven project, you will

                  our community. We will reserve 20% of all the minting funds
                  raised to revert to the community in the form of giveaways,
                  passive rewards, a comic series, and giving the chance to
                  choose where the roadmap takes us to!

                  We will provide an anti-paper hands system: Never sell below

                  stabilised and even they may rise steadily in this way too.

                  Additionally, if you deposit your TWF! NFT into the pool, you
                  will earn our token $TREES. Earn fees by providing liquidity,
                  and rewards by staking your $TREES+ETH LP Tokens. More info

          Your Tree With Faces is not only a collectible stored as a ERC-721

                Trees With Faces TWF! are randomly generated, non-fungible
                tokens, as well known as NFT. There are a total of 3,333
                different TWF! and they are minted, stored and traded on the
                Ethereum Blockchain. Each TWF! is completely unique. Generated
                from a smart contract using hand drawn traits such as heads,
                mouths, “hair” styles, eyes, clothes and other accessories such
                as cool glasses and icecreams, resulting in over 500,000
                potential combinations at generation time.

              ARE SOME TREES WITH FACES RARER THAN OTHERS?

            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>
                Every TWF! features unique traits/attributes, and some of them
                are rarer than others due to the randomization of the generation
                of the NFTs at minting time. Moreover, some are animated and
                others are unique, including those coming from special
                partnerships such as BakerySwap, Binamon and Dogecoin. Once the
                collection is released, you will be able to see the traits for
                you Tree With Faces under “Properties” on OpenSea, and,
                alternatively, on a third-party tool such as Rarity Tools of
                which TWF! is partner.

                Trees for the Future (TREES) is a regenerative agroforestry
                nonprofit association that works with farming communities in
                semi-arid Sub-Saharan Africa to end hunger, poverty and
                deforestation by training farmers to regenerate their land. We
                commit ourselves to making our first donation to Trees for the
                Future after selling out the collection, and it will be the
                community who will take over the helm for any other future
                contribution.
