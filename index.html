                Trees With Faces, TWF!, is a community-driven NFT collection of 3,333
                programmatically generated freaking cool trees seeded and living as NFTs on the
                Ethereum Blockchain. Some are cool. Others look weird. And some are simply unique,
                rare and even animated!
              </p>
              <p>
                Each Tree With Faces is a collectible that has been curated and randomly assembled
                from over 500k total options, each of them featuring shapes, outfits, faces and
                other peculiar elements that make each of them cool and rare on their own. Each TWF!
                is unique and no two are alike.
              </p>
              <p>
                Entering the TWF! world, you don't only hold an awesome PFP, but also join a family
                of cool friends in the Metaverse, with incentives like experiences, campaigns,
                $TREES token, liquidity pool, passive rewards, charity donation and much more. Are

                  form of giveaways, passive rewards, a comic series, and giving the chance to

                <p>
                  Additionally, if you deposit your TWF! NFT into the pool, you will earn our token

                  LP Tokens. More info will come will come soon.

                Trees With Faces TWF! are randomly generated, non-fungible tokens, as well known as
                NFT. There are a total of 3,333 different TWF! and they are minted, stored and
                traded on the Ethereum Blockchain. Each TWF! is completely unique. Generated from a
                smart contract using hand drawn traits such as heads, mouths, “hair” styles, eyes,
                clothes and other accessories such as cool glasses and icecreams, resulting in over
                500,000 potential combinations at generation time.

              <p>
                Every TWF! features unique traits/attributes, and some of them are rarer than others
                due to the randomization of the generation of the NFTs at minting time. Moreover,
                some are animated and others are unique, including those coming from special
                partnerships such as BakerySwap, Binamon and Dogecoin. Once the collection is
                released, you will be able to see the traits for you Tree With Faces under
                “Properties” on OpenSea, and, alternatively, on a third-party tool such as Rarity
                Tools of which TWF! is partner.

              <p>
                Trees for the Future (TREES) is a regenerative agroforestry nonprofit association
                that works with farming communities in semi-arid Sub-Saharan Africa to end hunger,
                poverty and deforestation by training farmers to regenerate their land. We commit
                ourselves to making our first donation to Trees for the Future after selling out the
                collection, and it will be the community who will take over the helm for any other
                future contribution.
